# What is Git
Git is one of famous Version Control System.
As the name implies, Version Control is about the management
of multiple versions of a project. To manage a version,
each change (addition, edition, or removal etc) to the files in
a project must be tracked. Version Control records each change
made to a file (or a group of files) and offers a way to undo
each change.
One of the most important advantages of using Version Control is teamwork.
When more than one person is contributing to a project, tracking changes
becomes very important because, it greatly increases the probability
of overwriting another personâ€™s changes.
With Version Control, multiple people can work on their copy of
the project (called branches) and only merge those changes to the
main project when they (or the other team members) are satisfied with the work.
